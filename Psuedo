1) When user clicks on generate password, my program begins
    - perhaps call my function when this button is clicked


2) Prompt user of how many characters?
    - validate that user typed in a number that is 8 - 128
    
    if number user typed in is less than < 8 OR > more than 128
        ask user to try again

    else
        proceed to next steps!

3) Charcter types, user must select must select at least 1

    Character Types:
        Special characters
        Numeric characters
        Lowercase characters
        Uppercase characters

    How can we solve this?

    - create confirms that stores the true/false booleans of each type
        i.e. "Click ok if you want special characters"

    - We should have 4 confirm questions

4) Generate password

    Give the size of user input we can now setup a loop

    For each iteration of the loop what can we do?
