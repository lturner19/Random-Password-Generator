# Random Password Generator 

## Introduction:
Welcome to my random password generator that was created using various JavaScript techniques.  This generator gives the user the ability to create a random password based on their response to four (4) questions. The user can then copy the clipboard to another program of their choice.
 

## Features
To initiate the generator, the user must click on the "Generate Password" button and then proceed to answer the following questions. Once the generator has created the password, the user can then click on the "Copy to Clipboard" button.
If the user does not enter the appropriate amount of the characters, they must reset the generator to continue use.
