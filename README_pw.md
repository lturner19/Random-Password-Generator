# Random Password Generator 

## Introduction:
Welcome to Random Password Generator a program created using various JavaScript techniques.  This generator gives the user the ability to create a random password with a specified length, based on their response to four (4) questions. Once the password is generated, the user has the ability to copy their password and use it where they like.

 

## Features
To initiate the generator, the user must click on the "Generate Password" button and then specify how many characters they would like the password to be.  The user is then asked four questions to select the type of characters that should be used in the password.

The type of characters a user can select are:

* Lower case letters
* Capital letters
* Numbers (0-9)
* Symbols (ex. !@#$)
 
 **If a user does not specify, or does not enter a number between 8 and 128, the generator will alert them to put in the appropriate number.
 
 After the password is created, the user can then click the "Copy to Clipboard" button.
